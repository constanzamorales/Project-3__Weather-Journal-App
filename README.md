# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires the student to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Technologies used

2. Run the server through the terminal with `node server.js`.
3. Go to `localhost:8000` in your browser.
